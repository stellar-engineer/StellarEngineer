# Distributables

Stellar Engineer requires [Unity Doorstop](https://github.com/NeighTools/UnityDoorstop) to function. Due to how this is set up, Unity Doorstop works by tricking the game into loading it by mimicking the `winhttp.dll` library (I think). For the sake of limiting compatability issues, I've decided to leave the release dll for Doorstop here, so that all devs on this project work with the same libraries.

The `setup.sh` script will handle inserting Unity Doorstop into your game.
